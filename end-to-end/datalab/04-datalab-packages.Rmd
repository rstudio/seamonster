It's useful to install some packages into the system library so that they are available to all R users. Install the following packages as `sudo` so they are available to all R users.

### install R packages

```{bash}
sudo /opt/R/3.4.3/bin/Rscript -e 'install.packages("shiny", repos = "http://cran.rstudio.com/")'
sudo /opt/R/3.4.3/bin/Rscript -e 'install.packages("rmarkdown", repos = "http://cran.rstudio.com/")'
sudo /opt/R/3.4.3/bin/Rscript -e 'install.packages("tidyverse", repos = "http://cran.rstudio.com/")'

sudo /opt/R/3.4.3/bin/Rscript -e 'install.packages("odbc", repos = "http://cran.rstudio.com/")'
sudo /opt/R/3.4.3/bin/Rscript -e 'install.packages("rstudioapi", repos = "http://cran.rstudio.com/")'
```
