Building R from source guarantees that R will run on your server, and it will allow you to run multiple versions of R side by side. Running multiple versions of R helps you maintain consistent R projects and Shiny apps over time.

### Install dependencies

First, ensure that you have the build dependencies required for R.

```{bash}
sudo apt-get build-dep r-base
```

If `build-dep` fails, you may need to add a repository. The following repository is designed to work with Ubuntu 16.04.

```{bash}
sudo apt-key adv --keyserver keyserver.ubuntu.com --recv-keys E298A3A825C0D65DFD57CBB651716619E084DAB9
sudo add-apt-repository 'deb [arch=amd64,i386] https://cran.rstudio.com/bin/linux/ubuntu xenial/'
```

### Build R from source (version 3.4.3)

Download the R source code from CRAN, then build with the usual configure/make/install. Enable the BLAS libraries using `--with-blas` so that low level math functions called from R run faster.

```{bash}
cd /opt
sudo wget https://cran.rstudio.com/src/base/R-3/R-3.4.3.tar.gz
sudo tar xzvf R-3.4.3.tar.gz 
cd R-3.4.3

sudo ./configure --prefix=/opt/R/3.4.3 --enable-R-shlib --with-blas --with-lapack
sudo make
sudo make install

/opt/R/3.4.3/bin/R
```

### Build multiple versions of R running side by side (optional)

Install another version of R from source.

```{bash}
rversion=3.3.1
cd /opt
sudo wget https://cran.rstudio.com/src/base/R-3/R-$rversion.tar.gz
sudo tar xzvf R-$rversion.tar.gz 
cd R-$rversion

sudo ./configure --prefix=/opt/R/$rversion --enable-R-shlib --with-blas --with-lapack
sudo make
sudo make install

/opt/R/$rversion/bin/R

sudo rstudio-server restart
```

### Install R binary from CRAN (optional)

If you want to install R from a CRAN binary, you can use the following command.

```{bash}
sudo apt-get install -y r-base r-base-dev
```
