Create a new sever instance on AWS EC2. See the [AWS documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/WindowsGuide/EC2_GetStarted.html) for detailed instruction.

1. This example uses an Ubuntu 16.04 image with 2 cores, 4 GB of RAM and 128 GB of disk. Your exact server size may very. 
2. Make sure to open these ports in your security group: 8787, 3939, 80.
3. Create a PEM key so you can log into your server.

### Log into your server

```{bash}
ssh -i ~/.ssh/my.pem ubuntu@<my-server-ip>
```

### Update your system

```{bash}
sudo apt-get update
```

```{bash}
sudo useradd -m rstudio
sudo echo "rstudio:mypassword" | chpasswd
```
