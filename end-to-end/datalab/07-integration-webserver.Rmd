The Apache web server is industry leading software for serving content across platforms. Apache does not depend on R, but you can embed R content into Apache via an iframe. If you host a Shiny application on RStudio Connect, then you can easily embed it into a web site or blog using the iframe tag.

## Install Apache

Install Apache. For detailed instructions see [here](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-linux-apache-mysql-php-lamp-stack-on-ubuntu-16-04).

```{bash}
sudo apt-get install -y apache2
```

Verify that Apache was installed properly by pointing your browser to your public IP. You should see the Apache initialization page.

## Update your html path

By default, the Apache web server uses `/var/www/html/` as its top level directory. You can redirect this path to your RStudio project directory. Create a symbolic link from `/var/www/html/` to your project path as shown below.

```{bash}
sudo mv /var/www/html/index.html /var/www/html/index.html_backup
sudo ln -s /home/rstudio/r-admin-2018/bitcoin/03-html/ /var/www/html
```

Very that your project path has loaded by pointing your web browser to your public IP. You should see the the index page stored in your project directory.
